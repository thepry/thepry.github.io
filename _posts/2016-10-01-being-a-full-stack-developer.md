Most people don't really get why this full stack thing is important. It's not about saving money or optimizing human resources in your company. This things are also important but the most important is that now developer can work on feauture all the way from planning up to shipping it to production. He can ship **feature** instead of just some code which should be used by front-end developer.

We should get rid of illusion that frontend is something completely different from backend. Developer works on features, he is shipping some value to businness. Not the lines of code. Not the *backend ruby* code. Languages, different interpreter environment(eg. server and browser) are just instruments, not the goal of dev's work.

And there's one more nice thing about being full stack developer. Since you work on whole feature, this feature becomes your own product. Something that **you** made. And it always feels good when you can see the exact result of your work.
